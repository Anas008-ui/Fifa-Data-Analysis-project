# Fifa-Data-Analysis-project
Analyzed FIFA 20 player data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover insights on player performance, wages, and national trends. Visualized top nationalities, most valuable clubs, and the relationship between player ratings and wages. It shows good insights about the players clubs, wages and nationalities

üèÅ Summary of FIFA Data Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed the FIFA 20 player dataset to uncover valuable insights about football players, clubs, and nations. Using Python, along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I explored the dataset, cleaned it, and visualized key statistics.

The analysis revealed several interesting trends:

* Top-performing nationalities such as Argentina, Portugal, and Spain showed the highest average player ratings, highlighting their strong football talent pools.

* Wage vs Overall Rating visualization showed a clear positive correlation higher-rated players tend to earn significantly higher wages, confirming that player value closely aligns with skill level.

* Top clubs by player count (like Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, and Manchester United) dominated the dataset, reflecting their strong representation of world-class players.

* Additional analysis of player attributes such as age, potential, and market value provided insights into how performance, experience, and reputation influence a player‚Äôs career and transfer worth.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization, and gained hands-on experience converting raw data into meaningful football insights.

This analysis demonstrates how data analytics can be applied in sports to understand player performance, talent distribution, and financial patterns in football.
